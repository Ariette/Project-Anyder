# Project Anyder

### What's the difference?

This is a forked version of GarlandTools for [Project Anyder](https://anyder.vercel.app) which is a unofficial database for FFXIV Korean service. <br>
It has several tweaks for Project Anyder, so it's not completely compatible with the original GarlandTools project. <br>
For Example, it does NOT produce fish.js and nodes.js becuase Project Anyder does not use Garland.Web frontend. <br>
Due to the delayed update of Korean server, It could be better to adopt already verified 3rd party data instead of extracting them from the client. So I applied those kinds of optimizations, too.
