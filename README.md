# GarlandTools Chinese Version

https://ffxiv.cyanclay.xyz

This is a modified version of garland tools to extract Chinese game client and produce chinese data.

## What's the difference?
Somehow fixed Graphic Exporter so it can run with 5.0 models, but there is still some texture related issue.
Chinese game client has no model infomation for mount and minions, so it is unable to export them now.

The site itself has been localized into Chinese version.

It also has some some modifications and functions modified by me to meet Chinese players needs.
